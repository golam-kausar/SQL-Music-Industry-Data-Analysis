# SQL-Music-Industry-Data-Analysis
### In this SQL project, I conducted an extensive analysis of customer spending patterns and music preferences within the music industry. The project aimed to derive actionable insights from a dataset encompassing invoices, customers, artists, genres, and track sales. Key analyses included:

Top Music Genres by Country: I identified the most popular music genres for each country by determining the genre with the highest number of purchases. This involved utilizing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and aggregate functions to calculate total purchases per genre and rank them.

Customer Spending Analysis: I analyzed the total amount spent by each customer on music, linking customer data with their respective invoices and purchases. This analysis allowed for a deeper understanding of customer behavior and preferences.

Best-Selling Artists: I explored the artists who generated the highest sales, focusing on rock genres specifically. By aggregating sales data, I identified the top artists and their total track counts, providing insights into market demand.

Top Customers per Country: I determined the customers who spent the most on music in each country, using window functions to rank customers based on their total spending. This analysis highlighted key customers, providing opportunities for targeted marketing and engagement strategies.

Throughout the project, I employed advanced SQL techniques, including joins, subqueries, and window functions, to manipulate and analyze the data effectively. The insights generated from this analysis can inform marketing strategies, sales efforts, and inventory management in the music industry
